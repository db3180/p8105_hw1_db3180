# Problem 1
Creating a data frame:

```{r}
  problem1_df = tibble( 
    first_dist = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
    a_logical = first_dist > 2,
    b_char = c("blue", "green", "blue", "green", "blue", "green", "blue", "green", "blue", "green"),
    c_factor = factor(b_char))
```

Converting variables
```{r}
as.numeric(a_logical, b_char, c_factor)
```
#Problem 2
Plotting

```{r}
set.seed(10)

plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000),
  y = rnorm(1000),
)

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram()
```
